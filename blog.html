Artificial intelligence is expected to contribute to every major breakthrough and completely change the way things are done. This will be a valuable contribution to all major industries. At this point, businesses need to understand the potential benefits that AI can bring to their business operations. The need arises for such tools that free humans to make decisions and allow machines to perform other predefined roles. These tools not only help in development but also greatly help in network and workflow optimization.
In this article, you will come to know about top 10 AI tools that we are using in this modern epoch.
TOP 10 AI TOOLS 
Here are some most renowned AI tools and platforms that we are using in the industry nowadays:

1.Scikit Learn
It is one of the most widely used libraries in the machine learning community. There are certain elements that make it a library for developers, such as cross-validation, feature extraction, and supervised learning algorithms. However, it runs on a single CPU processor. This library is built on SciPy, which includes Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Sympy, IPython and SciPy. The focus is on modeling data rather than manipulating it.

2. Tensorflow
TensorFlow is currently the most popular deep learning library. This machine learning framework from Google is an open source library compatible with Python. It is one of the best AI development tools that facilitates numerical calculations and makes future predictions easier and more accurate.
TensorFlow handles all the backend processing. This tool allows developers to build neural networks and create graphical visualizations using Tensorboard. TensorFlow applications can easily run on your local machine, the cloud, and Android and iOS devices. It is built for deployability and runs on both CPU and GPU.

3. PyTorch
The next competitor is the artificial intelligence tool PyTorch, which is also built on Python. It is similar to TensorFlow in the nature of selected projects. However, if you prioritize faster development, PyTorch is a better choice. If your project includes large and complex projects, TensorFlow will become obsolete.

4. CNTK
It's a Microsoft cognitive toolkit built on similar lines to TensorFlow, but it's not as easy to deploy. It has a wide range of APIs in Python, Java, C, C++, etc. and is primarily focused on building deep learning neural networks.

5. Caffe
It is open source developed at the University of California and has a Python interface. Ideal for academic research projects and industrial activities. It is one of the best tools used in artificial intelligence. This is due to its ability to process more than 60 million images per day.

6. Apache MXNet
This AI tool has been adopted by Amazon as a deep learning framework on AWS. Unlike other tools, this tool is not directly owned by a large company and provides an environment suitable for open source frameworks. It runs easily on multiple GPUs and machines. It also supports various APIs such as Python, C++, Scala, R, JavaScript, Julia, Perl and Go.

7. Keras 
It is a high-level open source neural network library with a Python interface. This very user-friendly tool is built on TensorFlow and is relatively easy to use. It is used for rapid prototyping and facilitates the completion of advanced experiments from start to finish with little or no latency. Keras runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU. Keras is one of the best open source AI tools available today. Since the backend is managed by the tool itself, there are no restrictions on how the tool can be used, and developers from various backgrounds are encouraged to try their hand at writing their own scripts. So it all depends on your intention.

8. OpenNN
The Open Neural Networks Library is another open source library used to simulate neural networks and is a major component of deep learning research. This library is written in C++ language. It is a platform for developers who want to upgrade to advanced analytics.

9. AutoML
It is one of the best AI tools available to machine learning engineers today. It uses machine learning techniques to automate processes related to discovering real-world problems. It helps data scientists shift their focus from mundane and repetitive tasks like modeling to solving the problem at hand. This tool paved the way for everyone to learn machine learning because it is easy to work with, even for those with little ML experience.

10. MyAI
My AI is a chatbot currently available on Snapchatters. In chat conversations, My AI can answer trivia questions such as recommend the best gift for a friend's birthday, help plan a long weekend hiking trip, or tell you what to make for dinner. You can make suggestions. While we are constantly striving to improve and evolve my AI, my AI responses may contain biased, inaccurate, harmful or misleading content. Because My AI is an evolving feature, you should always independently verify the answers provided by My AI before relying on any advice and not share confidential or confidential information.

          <p class="recent-post-text" >
            HOW TO CONVERT YOUR FACEBOOK PROFILE INTO A PAGE: STEP-BY-STEP TUTORIAL

            Outline:
            1. What is the difference between a Facebook profile and a Facebook page?
            2. Why would you need to convert a Facebook profile into a page?
            3. How to convert a profile into a page?
            4. Would it be beneficial for you?
            
            In this contemporary epoch, we all know how to create a Facebook profile. Most of us are not familiar with the process of creating a Facebook page or have never faced the need to create one. If you are a nonprofit organization with big goals that have a big impact on the community, you probably need a Facebook page. 
            
            WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FACEBOOK PROFILE AND A FACEBOOK PAGE?
            
            Facebook profile is where people share information about themselves. If you have already set up a Facebook profile, you have probably added content like your profile picture, your current city or town, your interests, and people you know as friends on Facebook. A Facebook profile is a great way to stay connected and share updates with friends and family online.
            
            Facebook pages are intended for businesses, creators, celebrities, non-profits or brands. Think of your page as a way to connect with your supporters and customers. Facebook Pages also have features like Insights, Ads, Permissions, and Monetization. This is because pages are better than profiles when it comes to marketing your business or monetizing your content on Facebook.
            
            WHY WOULD YOU NEED TO CONVERT A FACEBOOK PROFILE INTO A PAGE?
            Primarily, using your profile to represent something other than your personality that violates Facebook's Terms of Service. If you use a personal profile to represent your business and do not convert it to a Facebook page, your account may be permanently inaccessible.
            Creating a Facebook page for your organization also has many advantages. Converting your Facebook profile to a page gives you access to Facebook Insights and gives you the opportunity to share admin access. Collaborate with colleagues to create Facebook ads. Even if you are familiar with the layout of your profile, Facebook pages are definitely a better tool for your organization.
            
            HOW TO CONVERT A PROFILE INTO A PAGE?
            If you want to update your current profile to one that doesn't violate Facebook's terms and use that profile to build notoriety for your new page then you have to follow these steps.
            
            STEP 1 
            Go to create Facebook page based on your profile. Click "Get Started".
            STEP 2
            Follow the instructions on the screen. Choose the right category for your page and decide which friends, photos and videos you want to keep. Confirm your selection
            STEP 3
            Check the Publish Page When Done settings. Turn this setting off if you don't want your pages to be published automatically after conversion.
            STEP 4
            Check your privacy settings
            STEP 5
            Start a marketing strategy to promote your new posts, events, FB Live on your page.
            
            WOULD IT BE BENIFICIAL?
            Absolutely! Facebook pages are a recent phenomenon so definitely some knowledge is needed for the benefits of Facebook pages:
            
            Follow the rules - Facebook says profiles are for personal use and not for business purposes. In contrast, business accounts are designed for people who want to use Facebook to manage their pages and run advertising campaigns.
            Privacy - Business accounts are not found in searches. Also, the account owner cannot send or receive friend requests. Business owners can therefore rest assured that their privacy needs will be met.
            Fans - If you choose to migrate, all your friends will become fans. This is a huge advantage because you don't have to start from scratch and build a fan base for your business.
            Brand – A Facebook business page acts as a better brand ambassador for your business.

       content: "Artificial intelligence is expected to contribute to every major breakthrough and completely change the way things are done.\n This will be a valuable contribution to all major industries. At this point, businesses need to understand the potential benefits that AI can bring to their business operations.\n The need arises for such tools that free humans to make decisions and allow machines to perform other predefined roles. \nThese tools not only help in development but also greatly help in network and workflow optimization.In this article, you will come to know about top 10 AI tools that we are using in this modern epoch.\nTOP 10 AI TOOLS\n Here are some most renowned AI tools and platforms that we are using in the industry nowadays:\n1.Scikit Learn\n It is one of the most widely used libraries in the machine learning community. There are certain elements that make it a library for developers, such as cross-validation, feature extraction, and supervised learning algorithms. However, it runs on a single CPU processor. This library is built on SciPy, which includes Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Sympy, IPython and SciPy. The focus is on modeling data rather than manipulating it.\n2. Tensorflow\n TensorFlow is currently the most popular deep learning library. This machine learning framework from Google is an open source library compatible with Python. It is one of the best AI development tools that facilitates numerical calculations and makes future predictions easier and more accurate.TensorFlow handles all the backend processing. This tool allows developers to build neural networks and create graphical visualizations using Tensorboard. TensorFlow applications can easily run on your local machine, the cloud, and Android and iOS devices. It is built for deployability and runs on both CPU and GPU.\n\n3. PyTorch.\nThe next competitor is the artificial intelligence tool PyTorch, which is also built on Python. It is similar to TensorFlow in the nature of selected projects. However, if you prioritize faster development, PyTorch is a better choice. If your project includes large and complex projects, TensorFlow will become obsolete.4. CNTK.It's a Microsoft cognitive toolkit built on similar lines to TensorFlow, but it s not as easy to deploy. It has a wide range of APIs in Python, Java, C, C++, etc. and is primarily focused on building deep learning neural networks.\n5. Caffe.\nIt is open source developed at the University of California and has a Python interface. Ideal for academic research projects and industrial activities. It is one of the best tools used in artificial intelligence. This is due to its ability to process more than 60 million images per day.\n6. Apache MXNet\n.This AI tool has been adopted by Amazon as a deep learning framework on AWS. Unlike other tools, this tool is not directly owned by a large company and provides an environment suitable for open source frameworks. It runs easily on multiple GPUs and machines. It also supports various APIs such as Python, C++, Scala, R, JavaScript, Julia, Perl and Go.\n\n7. Keras\n .It is a high-level open source neural network library with a Python interface. This very user-friendly tool is built on TensorFlow and is relatively easy to use. It is used for rapid prototyping and facilitates the completion of advanced experiments from start to finish with little or no latency. Keras runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU. Keras is one of the best open source AI tools available today. Since the backend is managed by the tool itself, there are no restrictions on how the tool can be used, and developers from various backgrounds are encouraged to try their hand at writing their own scripts. So it all depends on your intention.8. OpenNNThe Open Neural Networks Library is another open source library used to simulate neural networks and is a major component of deep learning research. This library is written in C++ language. It is a platform for developers who want to upgrade to advanced analytics.\n9. AutoML \nIt is one of the best AI tools available to machine learning engineers today. It uses machine learning techniques to automate processes related to discovering real-world problems. It helps data scientists shift their focus from mundane and repetitive tasks like modeling to solving the problem at hand. This tool paved the way for everyone to learn machine learning because it is easy to work with, even for those with little ML experience.1\n0. MyAI\n.My AI is a chatbot currently available on Snapchatters. In chat conversations, My AI can answer trivia questions such as recommend the best gift for a friend's birthday, help plan a long weekend hiking trip, or tell you what to make for dinner. You can make suggestions. While we are constantly striving to improve and evolve my AI, my AI responses may contain biased, inaccurate, harmful or misleading content. Because My AI is an evolving feature, you should always independently verify the answers provided by My AI before relying on any advice and not share confidential or confidential information."
